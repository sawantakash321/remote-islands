# gazetteer Of Islands

A single-page application using Knockout.js, ES6, Webpack, the Google Maps API, World Tides API, Web Audio API, SASS/PostCSS, the BEM CSS class naming convention, code splitting, and responsive design.

The application is fully responsive. And when I say "fully" I damn well mean it! No font-sizes suddenly jumping in size at certain breakpoints here - nope! Instead, I use CSS viewport units throughout the application for width, height, and font-size - so be sure to check it out in Chrome DevTool's device emulation mode. Pull it, squish it, spin it - I challenge you to try make it look bad!

ES6 features used include arrow functions, destructuring, template strings, the spread operator, let/const, ES6 modules, object literal shorthand syntax, Promises, and default parameters. They're all here! Well, at least all the most useful ones anyhow. ES6 classes have no place in non-React code! :)
