    dead. They let the bodies hang from their huts until the flesh has decomposed, then wash the
    skeleton in the sea. The head is separated from the body; the bones are stored under the houses
    and the skull is kept under the stone of the terraces, on which the young men play with the
    frigate birds. They dance around the tame birds and throw objects at them until they cannot
    move any longer and their wings are flattened to the ground."</p>`

    fourth, fifth or sixth night. On the seventh day, their palates tighten and their throats
    constrict, so it becomes impossible to get them to swallow anything. Their muscles twitch and
    their jaws hang loose. Their eyes grow staring and they yawn a great deal; their open mouths
    stretch in mocking grimaces. Some die sooner, some later: one dies on the fourth day, another
    not till the twenty-first. The islanders whisper that it is the will of the Almighty. But
    these are the words of pious men. The women who endure so many pregnancies and bear so few
    children remain silent."</p>`
